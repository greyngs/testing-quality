Although the requirements specify that .py files must follow the Camel Case convention, the Pylint tool flags this as an error, which negatively affects the score. To resolve this and better align with Python conventions, it was decided to change the name to snake_case. According to PEP8 guidelines, when an existing project follows a different convention, that convention takes priority. In this context, since this is not an existing project, this decision aligns with PEP8 best practices and addresses the limitations identified with Pylint.
